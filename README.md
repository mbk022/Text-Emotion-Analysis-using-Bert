# Text-Emotion-Analysis-using-Bert
Text Message Analysis and classification using a pre-trained Bert Model - NLP


This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the emotion of text messages using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The BERT model is fine-tuned on a dataset annotated with emotional categories, allowing it to classify text messages into five distinct emotions: neutral, sadness, joy, fear, and anger. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The aim is to create a robust and accurate emotion detection system that can be utilized in applications such as sentiment analysis, customer service automation, and social media monitoring.
